# 2017-Software-Engineering-Project

This is the default readme we really don't need but eh, whatever.

I'm still new to Git and Github so this will be a work in progress.

Merge this shit.

ACHTUNG!! ACHTUNG!!
THIS IS NOT A VIRUS
THIS IS A FRIENDLY DOLPHIN
DOLPHINS CAN BE TRUSTED!

using the vim editor or nano you can change the code dynamically on a local branch
