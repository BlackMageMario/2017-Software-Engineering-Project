	<p>This Summer Camp has grown enormously over the past 3 years and we are pleased to announce that we are once again offering a 5 Day Science Summer School during the months of June and July 2017. Our programmes have been expanded and updated to cater for the needs of all our participants and to ensure that each child is fully catered for during our summer school. Children with special needs are welcomed but must be accompanied by a suitably qualified Special Needs Assistant.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Our Science Summer School is not only great value for money but it offers a week of fun, learning and excitement in a safe, secure and happy environment.</p>
